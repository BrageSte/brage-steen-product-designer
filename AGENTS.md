# Agent instructions

- For headset images, always inspect the preview versions first to avoid large files.
- Previews are in `public/projects/headset-pictures/previews/` and keep the same filenames as originals.
- Use the original images in the actual project/site (located in `public/projects/headset-pictures/`).
- When adding or replacing originals, generate matching previews with a max dimension of 2000 px.
