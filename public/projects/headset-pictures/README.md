# Headset pictures

## Preview workflow
- Use the preview images first when inspecting or discussing visuals.
- Previews live in `public/projects/headset-pictures/previews/` and mirror the original filenames.
- Always use the original images (in `public/projects/headset-pictures/`) in the actual site or project assets.

## Notes
- Previews are downscaled to a maximum of 2000 px on the longest side.
- If new originals are added, generate matching previews in the `previews/` folder with the same filenames.
